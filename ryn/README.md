# RYN Client v5.4

`RYN_Client_v5.4.user.js` — the client as uploaded, with one change: **autoheal
is now novastorm's rule and nothing else.**

## What autoheal was

RYN's autoheal already called itself "Novastorm's rule, whole", and the core of
it was. What sat on top were four guards novastorm does not have, in two files:

| Guard | Where | What it did |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_healsInFlight()` | `AntiInsta` | Subtracted apples already on the wire, so the same missing health was not paid for on every tick of the round trip |
| `isSaveHealTime()` | `AntiInsta` | Held the routine top-up until 125ms (ping allowed for) had passed since the hit, because an apple inside 120ms raises shame instead of lowering it |
| `myPlayer.shameActive` | `AntiInsta` | Sent nothing while the server was refusing food anyway |
| `_shameHealQueue` + packet budget | `ModuleHandler.heal()` | Deferred an apple that would land inside the 130ms window rather than dropping it, and refused to send with fewer than 3 packets of budget left |

All four are gone, along with `isSaveHealTick`, `isSaveHeal`, `_healSent`,
`_rawHeal`, `_healBudgetLeft`, `_flushShameHealQueue` and `_SHAME_GUARD_MARGIN`.
149 lines out, 51 in.

## What autoheal is now

Novastorm 15686 and, identically, X- Precision 14895 — the whole decision:

```js
if (currentHat == 6) totalDmgPot *= 0.75;
if (currentHat == 7) totalDmgPot += 5;
if (myPlayer.health <= totalDmgPot) healing = true;
if (((healing && myPlayer.shameCount < 7) || (tick - damageTick) > 0)
    && myPlayer.health < 100) heal(100 - myPlayer.health);
```

and the action, Novastorm 12747:

```js
function heal(value) {
    for (let i = 0; i < value; i += items.list[myPlayer.items[0]].heal)
        place(myPlayer.items[0], null);
}
```

Two branches with an OR between them and no third thing. `ModuleHandler.heal()`
is now the same shape: select food, swing, put the weapon back — unconditional.

**The number feeding the rule stays RYN's**, which is what "novastorm's rule,
RYN's logic" means here. `EnemyManager.potentialDamage +
potentialSpikeDamage` is already novastorm's `totalDmgPot`, summed from the
same five sources — spike contact, weapon hits in range and off reload, turret,
secondary, poison — so the rule is novastorm's and the estimator is RYN's.

One difference inside that estimator is worth knowing, because it is not a
guard and was left alone: novastorm's `spikeDmgPot` **adds** every spike
touching you, while RYN takes `Math.max(potentialSpikeDamage,
potentialSpikeKnockbackDamage)`. With two spikes on you, novastorm's number is
the larger of the two and heals sooner.

## What was kept, and why

**Anti Smart Tick.** Its branch sits ahead of the rule, unchanged. It has its
own toggle (`_antiSmartTick`), and it is not a heal decision — it is a refusal
to break out of a trap into a spike, where eating is what it does with the tick
instead. Deleting the autoheal around it would have silently switched off a
labelled feature. Say the word and it goes too.

**Three couplings the rest of the client reads.** `ModuleHandler.healedOnce`
(auto grind and the module handler both check it), `ModuleHandler.didAntiInsta`
(the UI's fast-Q indicator), and `this.blockBreak = false` at the top of
`postTick` (autoBreak reads the latch on the following tick). All still set.

## Verifying it

```
node harness/heal-duel.js
```

The port's acceptance test is that it becomes **indistinguishable from X-
Precision**, since both are now the same rule. It is:

```
  totals across every row
  client         apples   packets   wasted      shame locks  deaths
  X-             2676     10704     1815 (68%)  30           108
  RYN (was)      1230     4920      300 (24%)   6            96
  RYN (ported)   2676     10704     1815 (68%)  30           108

  RYN (ported) matches X- on every row — the rule is novastorm's, with nothing on top
```

The middle row is what was deleted, priced. Those guards were worth 1,446
apples and 5,784 packets across the three fights, and 24 of the 30 shame locks.
That is the cost of the change, and it is deliberate: novastorm pays it too.

## What is not verified

**The client does not boot in this harness**, and did not before the change
either — `boot-check.js` reports `Cannot read properties of null (reading
'appendChild')` in all four SDK states for both the pristine upload and this
file, identically. RYN builds DOM the mock page does not provide. So the change
is verified by `node --check`, by a dangling-reference sweep, by reading the
149 removed lines (every one belongs to a guard), and by the rule transcription
in `heal-duel.js` — not by running the client.
