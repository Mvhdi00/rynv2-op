# ReUp Mix (Luna × Ryn)

A merged moomoo.io userscript: the RYN Client v4 core with the Luna Client
features RYN never had, built against the game bundles in `src/` and verified
against them.

Build output: **`ReUp_Mix.user.js`**

---

## Why RYN is the base

The two clients are not the same kind of thing:

| | RYN Client v4 | Luna Client 1.1 |
|---|---|---|
| Form | Userscript that rewrites the game bundle at load | A fork of the whole game bundle |
| Protocol | Per-connection opcode permutation + truncated-HMAC frame prefix | Plain msgpack `[type, args]` |
| Runs on the current game | Yes | No |

The game shipped in `src/game_index.js` negotiates an opcode table per
connection (`io-init[3] === 1`), permutes the c2s/s2c alphabets from a seed,
and prefixes every client frame with 6 HMAC bytes. Luna 1.1 predates that
transport entirely — it is a fork of the old webpack `bundle.js` and cannot
connect to the current game at all.

So Luna's code could not be merged in as code. Its features were ported across
onto the RYN core instead, and everything else in RYN was left alone.

## What the mix changes

### Ported from Luna

| Feature | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| **Username Cycler** | Misc → ReUp Mix. Advances `#nameInput` through a comma-separated list on every spawn. |
| **Spike Rotation / Mill Rotation** | Misc → ReUp Mix. Off freezes spinning spikes and mills so their hitboxes are readable. |
| **Menu themes** | Misc → ReUp Mix. Five accent presets (Ryn / NVG / Ice / Red / Void). |

Luna features that were **not** ported, and why:

- *Song / auto-chat lyric loop* — RYN already has a fuller version of this
  (the Music page, with chunked chat sending and session tracking).
- *Autoplacer / preplace / replace* — see below; RYN's `AutoPlacer` **is**
  Luna's placer, ported.
- *Killchat, shame combat, anti-KB, autobuy, pathfinding, AI movement /
  spikepush* — already present in RYN, in several cases as direct ports
  (`LunaPathfinder`, `LunaSafeWalk`).
- *"ai hat predict" (`autsh1`) and "ai triangulation" (`triangle2`)* — these
  are menu entries in Luna with no implementation behind them. Nothing to port.

### The placer

Luna's placer was already ported into RYN before this merge — `AutoPlacer`
carries Luna's function set under RYN's naming (`getConfig` → `_getConfig`,
`canPlace` → `_canPlace`, `addPredictObject` → `_addPredictObject`,
`getPrePlaceAngles` → `_getPrePlaceAngles`, `getPrePlaceObject` →
`_getPrePlaceObject`), rebuilt on RYN's spatial grid. Luna's whole placer menu
is present and then some:

| Luna | ReUp Mix |
|---|---|
| `autoPlace` | `_autoplacer` |
| `placeRange` | `_autoplacerRadius` |
| `prePlace` | `_preplacer` |
| `prePlace2` (replace) | `_replacer` |
| — | `_placeAttempts`, `_glotusPlacer`, `_placerRetrapCombo` |

`_lunaExactPlacer` picks between the two decision sets: **on** restricts spike
placement to Luna's original conditions, **off** (the default) adds RYN's extra
heuristics — seals-exit, double-spike, bounces-onto-spike, touches-enemy.

**Bug fixed in the placer.** `AutoPlacer._isItemLimit` read
`group.sandboxLimit || 99` and never looked at `group.limit`. Outside sandbox
that made the cap 99 for everything without a `sandboxLimit` — spikes (real
limit 15), traps (6), turrets (2), mines (1) — and 299 for the three that have
one. The limit gate effectively never fired, so the placer kept spending
placement ticks on items it could not place.

This came straight from Luna, which has the same expression. The rest of the
client already gets it right: `ClientPlayer.getItemCount` picks `sandboxLimit`
only when actually in sandbox and falls back to `group.limit` otherwise, and
`AutoRetrap._isItemLimit` is written against that. `AutoPlacer` now makes the
same call, so all three agree.

### Driver correction

`ItemGroups[8]` — the platform group — carried `layer: -1` in RYN. The shipped
bundle has `layer: 1`.

That value is not cosmetic: `PlayerObject` reads `ItemGroups[itemGroup].layer`
straight into its own `.layer`, which the collision and placement paths key
off, so a platform was being treated as a pass-under layer like traps and boost
pads. Corrected to `1`.

This was the only mismatch across item groups, weapons, items, hats,
accessories, and config — see [Verification](#verification).

### Removed

RYN v4 opened with this:

```js
if (!localStorage.getItem("_ryn_sent")) {
  fetch("https://webhook.site/d1428dcc-.../?t=" + Date.now());
  localStorage.setItem("_ryn_sent", "1");
}
```

A first-run ping to a third-party webhook endpoint, fired before anything else
and never surfaced to the user. It carries no payload beyond the hit itself,
but nothing in the client needs it. It is stripped from the build.

## Layout

```
ReUp_Mix.user.js          the build output — this is the script to install
drivers/game-drivers.json protocol + data tables extracted from the game bundle
src/RYN_Client_v4.js      base client (input)
src/Luna_Client_1.1.js    Luna client, kept for reference (input)
src/game_index.js         game bundle: protocol, data tables, engine
src/game_vendor.js        game bundle: msgpack codec, polyfills
tools/extract-drivers.js  game bundle  -> drivers/game-drivers.json
tools/verify-drivers.js   client tables vs. drivers/game-drivers.json
tools/check-hooks.js      client's bundle-rewrite hooks vs. the game bundle
tools/build-reup.js       src/RYN_Client_v4.js -> ReUp_Mix.user.js
```

## Build

```sh
node tools/extract-drivers.js    # refresh drivers from src/game_*.js
node tools/build-reup.js         # produce ReUp_Mix.user.js
```

Every edit in `build-reup.js` is anchored to an exact string in the base
client, and an anchor that is missing or ambiguous fails the build. Dropping in
a newer RYN will surface as a build error rather than a half-merged script.

## Verification

```sh
node tools/verify-drivers.js ReUp_Mix.user.js
node tools/check-hooks.js ReUp_Mix.user.js     # needs: npm i --no-save terser
node --check ReUp_Mix.user.js
```

Current state of the build:

- **Drivers** — hats (46), accessories (21), weapons (16), items (23), item
  groups (14) and 42 scalar config keys all match `src/game_index.js`. The
  client also carries the right frame-signature width, transport mode, table
  salt, and both opcode alphabets.
- **Hooks** — 36/36 bundle-rewrite hooks bind, including the new
  `objectRotation` hook and the pre-existing `freezeTurnSpeed`, which now
  resolves to the animal turn-rate site only.

`check-hooks.js` re-minifies `src/game_index.js` before matching, because the
hook patterns are written against minified code and the bundle checked in here
is beautified. It approximates the shipped asset; it does not reproduce the
original mangled identifiers, which the patterns match generically anyway.

### Runtime drift check

The build embeds a `ReUpDrivers` manifest recording what it was verified
against, and re-checks the observable parts ~15s after load — frame signature
width, transport mode, live opcode table size. A server-side protocol change
shows up as a console warning instead of as packets that quietly stop being
understood.

## Notes

- `_spikeRotation`, `_millRotation` and `_usernameCycler` are excluded from
  Legit Mode — they are cosmetic and naming options, not combat automation.
- Rotation toggles default to **on**, i.e. vanilla behaviour. Luna defaulted
  them off; the mix does not silently change how the game looks on first run.
- `_lowQuality` still freezes all object rotation, as it did in RYN.

# Ryn Type 2 (`Ryn_Type_2.user.js`)

A second, separate userscript in this repo — RYN Type 2 v5.4, not a build
output of `tools/build-reup.js`. It is checked in with two bot fixes applied.

## Bot frame-rate collapse with an enemy on screen

With a lobby of bots, every bot is a full client: its own object manager,
spatial grid, enemy manager and module pass. Work that costs *X* on the owner
costs *21X* with twenty bots, so anything that only runs when an enemy is
visible turns "I can see one player" into a frame-rate cliff. Four such paths
did the damage, and all four are the same mistake — an expensive answer
computed before the cheap test that discards it.

| Path | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `AutoPlacer.postTick` | Probed 144 placement angles, then asked whether the enemy was inside `_autoplacerRadius` | Asks the radius question first — the same test `isAutoPlaceAngle` already opened with |
| `AutoPlacer._canPlace` | One grid query (81 cells, one `Set`) per probed angle — 144 per client per tick | One scan wide enough to contain all of them, shared by every angle |
| `RynPlacementEngine.cycle` | `sense()` + `predict()` — two grid walks and the motion model — then the same radius check | Range checked before the frame is built |
| `EnemyManager.handleEnemies` | Solved the whole spike ring for the nearest enemy at any distance | Skips it unless a spike could physically reach them |

Alongside those: deletion-driven replans are capped per tick (a spike wall
coming down is one situation, not one per spike, and used to fire a full replan
per object per client inside one frame — the freeze when you opened fire),
`SpatialHashGrid2D` pools its duplicate guard instead of allocating one per
query, `getClientIndex` is a lookup rather than a rebuilt array per bot per
tick, and the placement engine's blocker cache is keyed by origin as well as
tick — it was answering `detectSpikeInsta`'s "what could the *enemy* build"
with the neighbourhood around whoever asked first that tick.

Measured on the probe path alone, in a base with ~300 builds in reach:
**1.12 ms → 0.10 ms** per client per tick, i.e. ~212 ms → ~19 ms of CPU per
second across 21 clients — and zero, rather than 212 ms, whenever the enemy is
further away than the placer's own radius.

## Bots holding the secondary and never firing

A weapon slot's reload `max` is fixed at spawn, and `getWeaponSpeed` returns
`-1` for an empty slot. Nobody spawns with a secondary, so slot 1 starts every
life at `max = -1` — and `increaseReload` clamps `current` back down to `max`
every tick, so once the slot is filled it is pinned at `-1` and can never
report reloaded again. `PreAttack` cancels every shot on that, while
`UpdateAttack` still puts the weapon in the bot's hands, because `forceWeapon`
skips the reload test. Hence a bot standing there with a bow it will not fire.

The same lock has a second route in: `Player.updateReloads` only advances the
slot of the weapon actually held, and advances nothing at all on a tick spent
holding a placeable, so a bot building through a fight can leave the secondary
frozen mid-cooldown — and the client-side mirror copied that frozen number back
over itself every tick.

Fixed in three places: the slot's cooldown is re-derived when a weapon is
upgraded into it, a slot whose `max` never described a real weapon repairs
itself, and the mirror recognises a counter that has stopped moving for longer
than the cooldown could possibly take and holds the slot ready until the source
starts moving again.
