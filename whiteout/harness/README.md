# Whiteout harness

Runs `../Whiteout_v4_1.user.js` in a real browser against a mock moomoo.io page
and a mock game server, and reports what the client draws and what it throws.

The green-screen bugs this was built for could not be found by reading: one only
appears when the userscript loses a load-order race, the other only when a
sprite host is unreachable. Both are one line in a console the player never
opens. The harness makes each of them a reproducible pass/fail.

## Setup

```sh
npm install          # playwright, ws, @msgpack/msgpack, jquery
node build-page.js   # synthesises index.html and copies the bundles from ../../src
```

`build-page.js` builds the page from the element ids `src/game_index.js` and the
client actually reach for. It reproduces script types and load order — the game
ships as an ES module, which is what its WebSocket capture races against — but
not layout or art. Sprite hosts are unreachable from the sandbox, so every run
is also a test of the client with every image broken.

## Running

```sh
node play.js                  # normal load order
node play.js "" native        # userscript injected late (see below)
node chaos.js                 # transient mid-frame fault, then recovery
```

`play.js` prints the distinct colours sampled off the canvas — a live world is
~15-20, an empty green one is 1 — followed by every page error and console
warning, deduplicated.

### `native` mode

The game bundle snapshots `window.WebSocket` into a module-local on its first
line, then locks the property so it cannot be re-hooked. `native` opens the game
socket through a constructor captured *before* the client ran, which is exactly
what happens when the userscript manager injects a moment late. Before the fix
this printed `distinctColours: 1` and no errors at all: a silent, perfectly
uniform green screen.

### `chaos.js`

Injects a throw into the render loop after a `ctx.save()` and before its
`restore()` — the shape the `bowTie` draw had — holds it for a second, then
clears it. It reports colour count *and* whether the canvas is still changing,
because a wedged loop leaves the last good frame on screen and still looks rich:

```
  before fault         colours=20 drawing=yes
  during fault         colours= 3 drawing=no
  after fault cleared  colours=18 drawing=yes
  recovered: YES
```

Run it against the pre-fix script and `after fault cleared` stays
`drawing=no` — the leaked save-stack means one bad frame is permanent.

## Limits

The mock server speaks the real transport (`io-init`, per-connection opcode
permutation, 6-byte signed client frames) and sends enough packets to spawn,
render and tick. It is not the game: it does not validate what the client sends
back, and it covers only the packets in `server.js`. A clean run here means the
client loads, connects, renders and survives; it is not a substitute for
playing.
